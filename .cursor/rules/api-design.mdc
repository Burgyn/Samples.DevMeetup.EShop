# API Design - Guide
- **Implementation:**
  - Use minimal API approch for creating API
  - Maintain a consistent style throughout the application
- **Architectual Design Pattern:**
  - Use vertical slice architecture to organize endpoints and their features.
  - Each feature is separate slice
  - Do not use MediatR and other CQRS framework
  - For each module use Setup.cs class with extensions for DI registration and endpoints mapping. Like `.AddPartners()`, `.MapPartners()`
- **Validation:** Use exclusively the FluentValidation library for input validation
- **Learning by Example:** Study and follow the conventions of existing endpoints in the application
