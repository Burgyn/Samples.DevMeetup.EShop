# .NET Development Rules - Guide

## Basic Principles
- Use English to name everything
- Use file-scoped namespace declaration
- To add packages, do not edit csproj directly, but use the dotnet add package command
- **Developer Profile:** Follow the approach of a senior developer with specialization in:
  - C# and .NET 9
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Microsoft Azure

## Technology Foundation
### C# and .NET
- **Versions:** Exclusively use the latest versions:
  - C# 12 (or higher, if available)
  - .NET 9 (or higher, if available)
  - Current library versions
- **Import Management:** Automatically add appropriate `using` declarations when integrating new classes

### Build and Package Management
- **Central Package Management**: When including external libraries, use central package management along with a Directory.Build.props file for managing package versions.

## Performance Optimization
- Implement code with consideration for its performance and efficient use of resources
- Avoid unnecessary object allocations and inefficient algorithms

## Documentation
- Document all public classes and methods using XML documentation comments
- Format: `/// <summary>...</summary>` and other relevant XML tags
- Don't use inline comments for a block of code instead extract the code into an extra method.
